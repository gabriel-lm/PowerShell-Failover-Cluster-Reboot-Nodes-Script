# PowerShell-Failover-Cluster-Reboot-Nodes-Script
I wrote this script to partially automate and lower the hours spent on monthly update patching for a client on a Hyper-V Failover Cluster environment, which took over 5 hours. The patch installation was done using PoshPAIG, since the customer did not want to use a WSUS for the updates. After this the nodes needed to be paused, the roles moved the other nodes in the cluster and then the node could be rebooted. All of this was done manually for about 25 clusters. The script does all of this, for every node in a cluster. It drains the roles from the node, it pauses the node, next it reboots the node, after the node is back up, it resumes the node and only then does the before mentioned to the next node in the cluster. I had a lot of fun writing this script and was a great way to learn about PowerShell and what it can do.  P.S. This is my first PowerShell script.
